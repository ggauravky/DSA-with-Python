# variable:

x = 10
name = "Alice"

# keyword:
def greet():
    print("Hello, " + name)
greet()

# Note: In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and cannot be used as variable names. Examples of keywords include 'def', 'return', 'if', 'else', etc.
# For example, 'def' is a keyword used to define functions, as shown above.
# In this example, 'x' and 'name' are variables that store data, while 'def' is a keyword used to define the function 'greet'.
